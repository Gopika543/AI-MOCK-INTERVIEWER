### Project Description
[Job interviews are a crucial part of securing a job, but many candidates struggle with interview preparation due to the lack of realistic and personalized practice. While traditional mock interviews are helpful, they can be time-consuming, costly, or difficult to access. Furthermore, candidates often do not receive immediate, actionable feedback on their performance. As a result, many are left uncertain about how well they answered questions, or what areas they need to improve on.]

### The Problem statement
[Job seekers face challenges in preparing for interviews due to a lack of personalized, real-time, and scalable practice opportunities. There is no easy way for candidates to simulate real-world interview scenarios, get dynamic feedback, and track their progress in a convenient and accessible way.]

### The Solution
[MockMate solves this problem by providing an AI-powered mock interview system that tailors questions to the user‚Äôs chosen job role and experience level. By selecting a specific role and experience, users receive personalized interview questions generated by the AI in real-time. Users can record their responses, and the AI evaluates the answers based on key criteria, providing them with a score and actionable feedback.]
